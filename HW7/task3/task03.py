If there is "o" winner, function should return "o wins!"
If there is a draw, function should return "draw!"
If board is unfinished, function should return "unfinished!"
Example:
    [[-, -, o],
     [-, x, o],
     [x, o, x]]
    Return value should be "unfinished"
    [[-, -, o],
     [-, o, o],
     [x, x, x]]
     Return value should be "x wins!"
